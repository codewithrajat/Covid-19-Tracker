            </tr>
            <td>
            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                This debate started when the ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, Sowa Rigpa and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) released an advisory council suggesting that some Unani medicines can help to prevent the coronavirus infection. However, there is no scientific backing that supports this claim, so far.

            </tr>
            <td>
            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Vitamin C was believed to have some healing benefits in the SARS outbreak. Besides, while Vitamin C supplements may help boost your immune system, there is yet no evidence that it might help people fight off the new coronavirus.

            </tr>
            <td>
            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Although the ratio of old people getting infected is a little higher, it is because of their weak immune system and underlying co-morbidities. People with pre-existing diabetes mellitus, kidney disease and heart conditions are also at a greater risk for the infection and mortality. Young people also get infected, although mortality rates are on lower side.

            </tr>
            <td>
            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Because of the antimicrobial properties of garlic, people think it also prevents the COVID-19 infection. However, the WHO has already cleared that there is no evidence whatsoever that it prevents the virus.

            </tr>
            <td>
            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Although the previous coronaviruses—SARS and MERS—survived better in cold environments, there is no guarantee that the same will be true for COVID-19. From the evidence so far, the novel coronavirus can be transmitted in all areas, including areas with hot and humid weather. And assuming that the virus will disappear in the summer would be a false hope.

            </tr>
            <td>
            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Coronavirus symptoms for a majority of the people infected include cough, mild fevers, sore throat, headache, and body ache. While drinking warm water can make you feel better, there is no evidence that it will not cure you. Having a bath in hot water won't work either, according to WHO, since the body temperature remains at an average of 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the temperature of your bath or shower.

            <td>
            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                The virus doesn’t spread through consumption of meat—chicken, mutton, or fish, and avoiding it doesn’t mean you will be safe. It can be spread when someone comes in contact with respiratory droplets of an infected person. And the only way to prevent this is regular use of hand sanitizers and social distancing.

            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                You cannot conclude this by holding your breath for 10 seconds. Many young patients can hold their breath even longer, while elderly people cannot hold the breath for 10 seconds even without the infection. The only way to make sure you are not infected is to get a laboratory test done.

            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                This myth started when a dog was tested positive in Hong Kong. But later it was found that it was because the dog owner was infected with the virus, and when tested, the virus was found in the dog’s canine. However, WHO stepped in telling that coronavirus in dogs is not possible.

            <td>
            -> <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                No, spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill viruses that have already entered your body. They are useful to disinfect surfaces when used under appropriate recommendations. But using them on your body can be harmful for your clothes or mucous membranes (i.e. eyes, mouth).
